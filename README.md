A selected number of challenges from https://github.com/karan/Projects-my. Just trying to get familiarity with syntax out of the way so I can focus on the things that really matter - A Rosetta stone, if you will.




Numbers
---------

**Find PI to the Nth Digit** - Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

**Fibonacci Sequence** - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.

**Prime Factorization** - Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.

**Next Prime Number** - Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.

**Find Cost of Tile to Cover W x H Floor** - Calculate the total cost of tile it would take to cover a floor plan of width and height, using a cost entered by the user.

**Mortgage Calculator** - Calculate the monthly payments of a fixed term mortgage over given Nth terms at a given interest rate. Also figure out how long it will take the user to pay back the loan.

**Change Return Program** - The user enters a cost and then the amount of money given. The program will figure out the change and the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies needed for the change.

**Binary to Decimal and Back Converter** - Develop a converter to convert a decimal number to binary or a binary number to its decimal equivalent.

**Calculator** - A simple calculator to do basic operators. Make it a scientific calculator for added complexity.

**Distance Between Two Cities** - Calculates the distance between two cities and allows the user to specify a unit of distance. This program may require finding coordinates for the cities like latitude and longitude.


**Tax Calculator**asks the user to enter a cost and either a country or state tax. It then returns the tax plus the total cost with tax.

**Factorial Finder** - The Factorial of a positive integer, n, is defined as the product of the sequence n, n-1, n-2, ...1 and the factorial of zero, 0, is defined as being 1. Solve this using both loops and recursion.


**Number Names** - Show how to spell out a number in English. You can use a preexisting implementation or roll your own, but you should support inputs up to at least one million (or the maximum value of your language's default bounded integer type, if that's less). *Optional: Support for inputs other than positive integers (like zero, negative integers, and floating-point numbers).*

**Sudoku Solver** - Sounds about right, input an incomplete sudoku and it (should) be solved.

Classic Algorithms
-----------------

**Collatz Conjecture** - Start with a number *n > 1*. Find the number of steps it takes to reach one using the following process: If *n* is even, divide it by 2. If *n* is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

**Sorting** - Implement two types of sorting algorithms: Merge sort and bubble sort.

**Sieve of Eratosthenes** - The sieve of Eratosthenes is one of the most efficient ways to find all of the smaller primes (below 10 million or so).




Text
---------

**Reverse a String** - Enter a string and the program will reverse it and print it out.

**Pig Latin** - Pig Latin is a game of alterations played on the English language game. To create the Pig Latin form of an English word the initial consonant sound is transposed to the end of the word and an ay is affixed (Ex.: "banana" would yield anana-bay). Read Wikipedia for more information on rules.

**Count Vowels** - Enter a string and the program counts the number of vowels in the text. For added complexity have it report a sum of each vowel found.

**Check if Palindrome** - Checks if the string entered by the user is a palindrome. That is that it reads the same forwards as backwards like “racecar”

**Count Words in a String** - Counts the number of individual words in a string and display the top 5/10 most used words.

**Quote Tracker (market symbols etc)** - A program which can go out and check the current value of stocks for a list of symbols entered by the user. The user can set how often the stocks are checked. For CLI, show whether the stock has moved up or down. *Optional: If GUI, the program can show green up and red down arrows to show which direction the stock value has moved.*

Classes
---------

**Product Inventory Project** - Create an application which manages an inventory of products. Create a product class which has a price, id, and quantity on hand. Then create an *inventory* class which keeps track of various products and can sum up the inventory value.


**Shape Area and Perimeter Classes** - Create an abstract class called Shape and then inherit from it other shapes like diamond, rectangle, circle, triangle etc. Then have each class override the area and perimeter functionality to handle each shape type.

Web
---------

**Page Scraper** - Create an application which connects to a site and pulls out all links, or images, and saves them to a list. *Optional: Organize the indexed content and don’t allow duplicates. Have it put the results into an easily searchable index file.*

Databases
---------
**Budget Tracker** - Write an application that keeps track of a household’s budget. The user can add expenses, income, and recurring costs to find out how much they are saving or losing over a period of time. *Optional: Allow the user to specify a date range and see the net flow of money in and out of the house budget for that time period.*
